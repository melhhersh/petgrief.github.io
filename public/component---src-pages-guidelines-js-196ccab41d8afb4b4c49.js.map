While you may share some commonalities in your experiences, no two of you are exactly alike. Consequently, respect and accept both what you have in common with others and what is unique to each of you.</li>\n<li>Grief is not a disease, and no “quick-fix” exists for what you are feeling. Don’t set a specific timetable for how long it should take you or others to heal.</li>\n<li>There is a difference between actively listening to what another person is saying and expressing your own grief. Make every effort not to interrupt when someone else is speaking.</li>\n<li>Thoughts, feelings and experiences shared in this group will stay in this group. Respect others’ right to confidentiality. Do not use names of fellow participants in discussions outside the group.</li>\n<li>Allow each person equal time to express himself or herself so a few people don’t monopolize the group’s time.</li>\n<li>Attend each group meeting and be on time.</li>\n<li>Avoid “advice giving” unless it is specifically requested by a group member. If advice is not solicited, don’t give it.</li>\n<li>If a group member poses a question, share ideas that helped you if you experienced a similar situation.</li>\n<li>Recognize that thoughts and feelings are neither right nor wrong. Enter into the thoughts and feelings of other group members without trying to change them.</li>\n<li>Create an atmosphere of willing, invited sharing. If you feel pressured to talk but don’t want to, say so. Your right to quiet contemplation will be respected by the group.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support Group Ethics</h3>\n<p><i>Dignity & Worth: </i>\nEach group member has dignity and worth as a human being and as a person who has suffered a loss of their pet. Even when members express divergent beliefs about death and dying, or have very different experiences with loss, we encourage mutual respect and tolerance within the group.\n</p><p>\n<i>Confidentiality: </i>\nWhat is shared in our support group is private and should not be divulged to anyone. The only exception to this principle is if a group member expresses intent to harm himself/herself or others.\n</p><p>\n<i>Social Justice: </i>\nOur grief support group exhibits non-discriminatory practices and allow equal access to the group. All members regardless of age, sex, race, origin, sexual preference, etc. must feel welcome. Further, we encourage non-discrimination based on religious and cultural beliefs so relevant to death and dying.\n</p><p>\n<i>Mutual Responsibility: </i>\nThe work that occurs in our grief support group is a function of interdependence among group members. Each member is valued as an important contributor. We strive to foster an atmosphere where members believe they each have something to gain from listening to, and understanding the others.\n</p><p>\n<i>Cultural Sensitivity: </i>\nA variety of cultural values, beliefs, and practices may be represented in a our grief support group. This diversity is welcomed; we practice sensitivity and openness to the different cultures represented.\n</p><p>\n<i>Empowerment: </i>\nGroup members have the potential to take charge of their own bereavement process and guide their own growth and healing. We model respect for each individual to chart his or her own unique path to a new life.\n</p><p>\n<i>Self-Determination: </i>\nGroup members have the right to join or leave our grief support group whenever they choose, and their input on group logistics, format, and topics is encouraged.\n</p><p>\n<i>Professional Competence: </i>\nWe take pride in having the required knowledge and skills to lead this grief support group. We also strive to keep up-to-date on current bereavement knowledge and group strategies.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Accident Waiver and Release of Liability Form</h3>\n<p>I HEREBY ASSUME ALL OF THE RISKS OF PARTICIPATING IN ANY/ALL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS GRIEF SUPPORT GROUP, including by way of example and not limitation, any risks that may arise from negligence or carelessness on the part of the persons or entities being released, from dangerous or defective equipment or property owned, maintained, or controlled by them, or because of their possible liability without fault.\n\nI certify that I am physically fit, have sufficiently prepared for participation in this activity, and have not been advised to not participate by a qualified medical professional.
